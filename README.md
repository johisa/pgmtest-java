# pgmtest-java
Test for prospect employees and consultants

================================================================================
1 Programming tasks - Description
================================================================================

# What you need to do
**It is your job to implement at least 4 of the methods in ```ProgrammingTasks``` and an implementation of ```Stack```**

**We also like to see that you add some extra tests for the methods you implement**

Interfaces for the contract to implement and stubs are under this path, and shall be used for implmentation, 
Javadoc for what the methods do is provided in the code.

### Location of classes
The code shall be implemented under 
src/main/java/com/pierceecom/pgmtest
- ```ProgrammingTasksImpl```
- ```StackImpl```

**The stack should implement the iterator in LIFO order and you should provide your implementation without using 
classes from Java Standard Lib or 3rd part libraries**

### Assessment
The assessment will be based on following criterias:
- Clean design
- Reuse (of code and 3rd party products)
- Maintainability
- Ability to test
- Java Knowledge Base
- Coding style

## Tests
We supply tests, but no implementations The tests are set up to catch UnsupportedOperationException so they do not fail.
We encourage you to also write extra tests.


### Location of tests
The tests are under
src/test/java/com/pierceecom/pgmtest
- ```ProgrammingTasksTest```
- ```StackTest```


*Observe that the tests supplied are just an initial set of tests, and more may be used to test your implementation.*

2 AT THE INTERVIEW
================================================================================
Be prepared to talk about things needed in the work as a developer, such as tool to help a developer etc.

Be prepared to discuss around architecture to see how much knowledge you have about the topic. 

This can be:
- suggest a design for a web application
- suggest steps to take to get this application into production
- discussion around concepts in Java EE
